# Bamazon_Manager

** How it works video:** 

NPM packages installed:
* msql
* inquirer 

Amazon like app Manager View Node application called `bamazonManager.js`. Running this application will:

  * List a set of menu options:

    * View Products for Sale
    
    * View Low Inventory
    
    * Add to Inventory
    
    * Add New Product (through validating existing departments)

 * If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app lists every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

 * If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it lists all items with an inventory count lower than five.

  * If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, your app displays a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

  * If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it allows the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
